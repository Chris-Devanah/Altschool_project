**Project Overview**:

A microservices-based architecture application is deployed on Kubernetes and thereâ€™s a need to create a clear IaaC (Infrastructure as Code) deployment to be able to deploy the services in a fast manner.
This project will be implemented using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Kubernetes for container orchestration, Helm for package management, and Prometheus for monitoring.

**PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:**


Socks Shop Application

Terraform

AWS Account

Kubernetes

Helm

Prometheus


**The following tools and technologies will be used in the project:**

Terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files, creating infrastructure as code using a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

AWS Account: An AWS account will be required to provision the necessary infrastructure resources, such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster.

Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that provides an easy way to manage software built for Kubernetes.

Prometheus: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts based on predetermined conditions.

Socks Shop Application: The Socks Shop application is a popular microservices-based e-commerce platform that is used for this project.
